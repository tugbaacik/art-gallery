# 🎨 3D Virtual Art Gallery

This project is an interactive **3D Virtual Art Gallery** developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It features a richly constructed scene with various realistic 3D models, animations, lighting effects, and camera controls to simulate the feel of exploring a digital art space.

## 📌 Overview

The application creates a virtual exhibition environment that brings together artistic and decorative 3D models:
- Supports `.obj` model loading
- Real-time navigation and animations
- Realistic materials and lighting settings
- Keyboard and orbit-based user interaction

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Multiple .OBJ models such as mugs, thermoses, sculptures, trees, chairs, and architectural elements
- 🌌 Skybox-based environment (6-sided cubemap for realistic sky)
- 💡 Ambient, directional, and point lights for detailed illumination
- 🧭 Keyboard controls for movement (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`)
- 🌀 Moving and rotating objects with color animation
- 💠 Extruded geometry with custom bevel settings
- 🕹️ OrbitControls for interactive camera rotation and zoom
